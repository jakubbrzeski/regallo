I. GENERATING JSON WITH CONTROL FLOW GRAPH

    1. Get Clang and LLVM.
    Requirements:
        - LLVM 5.0 (with opt tool)
        - Clang (older versions should work)
    Dynamic library needed for control flow extraction was compiled using LLVM 5.0 and
    this version is neccessary to run it. clang (older versions should work)
    LINK: http://releases.llvm.org/download.html#5.0.0

    2. Extracting CFG from programs in C into json.
    For each .c file:
        a) Compile to .ll (LLVM IR)
        clang -S -emit-llvm file.c
        
        b) extract control flow graph into json:
        opt -mem2reg -load=path/to/LLVMCFGextractor.dylib -extract_cfg file.ll -to-json file.json

    (Optional) VISUALIZE CFG
    opt -mem2reg -dot-cfg hello.ll (For each function in ll generates .dot.cfg file)
    dot -Tpng file.dot -o file.png (Generates PNG with visualized CFG of the function)


II. PY-REGALLO

    1. Install all required python libraries.
    py-regallo/make

    2. For interactive use and tutorial reading ipython is necessary.
    pip install ipython

    3. To learn how to use py-regallo follow the tutorial.
    ipython notebook py-regallo/tutorial/tutorial.ipynb
